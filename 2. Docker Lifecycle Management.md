- **Docker Container Lifecycle Management**
 
The lifecycle of a docker container consists of five states:
  -   **1.	Created state**
  -   **2.	Running state**
  -   **3.	Paused state**
  -   **4.	unpaused state**
  -   **5.	Stopped state**
  -   **6.	Killed/Deleted state**


  1.	Created state
   
      In the created state, a docker container is created from a docker image

  2.	Running state

      In the running state, the docker container starts executing the commands mentioned in the image. To run a docker container, use the docker run command.

  3.	Paused state

      In the paused state, the current executing command in the docker container is paused. Use the docker pause command to pause a running container.

   - **Note:** docker pause pauses all the processes in the container. It sends the SIGSTOP signal to
   pause the processes in the container.

  4.	Unpaused state
    
    In the unpaused state, the paused container resumes executing the commands once it is unpaused. Use the docker unpause command to resume a paused container.
    Then, Docker sends the SIGCONT signal to resume the process.

  5.	Stopped state
     
     In the stopped state, the container’s main process is shutdown gracefully. Docker sends SIGTERM for graceful shutdown, and if needed, SIGKILL, to kill the 
     container’s main process. Use the docker stop command to stop a container.

  6.	Killed/Deleted state

     In the killed state, the container’s main processes are shutdown abruptly. Docker sends a SIGKILL signal to kill the container’s main process.

- **Difference between Docker Create, Docker Start and Docker Run :** 
 
Docker create command creates a new container from the specified image. However, it will not run the container immediately. Docker start command is used to start any stopped container. If we used the docker to create a command to create a container, then we can start it with this command. Docker run command is a combination of creating and start as it creates a new container and starts it immediately. In fact, the docker run command can even pull an image from Docker Hub if it doesn’t find the mentioned image on your system. 
 
- **Difference Between Docker Pause and Docker Stop container :**
 
The docker pause command suspends all processes in the specified containers. Traditionally, when suspending a process the SIGSTOP signal is used, which is observable by the process being suspended. Also, the memory portion would be there while the container is paused and again the memory is used when the container is resumed. When we use the docker stop command, the main process inside the container receives SIGTERM signal, and after some time, SIGKILL. Also, it will release the memory used after the container is stopped. SIGTERM is the signal of termination. The intention is to kill the process, gracefully or not, but to first allow it a chance to clean up. SIGKILL is the kill signal. The only behavior is to kill the process, immediately. SIGSTOP is the pause signal. The only behavior is to pause the process. The shell uses pausing (and its counterpart, resuming via SIGCONT) to implement job control.
