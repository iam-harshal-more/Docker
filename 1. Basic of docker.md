## **What is Docker?**

Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime. Using Docker, you can quickly deploy and scale applications into any environment and know your code will run
What is Containers?
A container is a lightweight, isolated ienvironment that packages an application and its dependencies, allowing it to run consistently and reliably across different computing environments. Containers provide a standardized and portable way to deploy software, ensuring that it works consistently regardless of the underlying infrastructure.
Containers use technologies like Docker that leverage operating system-level virtualization. Unlike traditional virtual machines (VMs), which emulate an entire operating system, containers share the host system's kernel and include only the necessary components to run the application. This makes containers lightweight, allowing them to start quickly and use fewer resources, resulting in better performance compared to VMs.

Virtual Machine (VM) vs Container 
Virtual Machines and containers are two different technologies, each managing resources and isolation in its own way.
Virtual Machines (VM)
* 	A virtual machine (VM) is a software emulation of a physical computer system. It runs an entire operating system and applications on top of a hypervisor or virtualization software.
* VMs provide hardware-level virtualization, allowing multiple VMs to operate on a single physical host. Each VM has its own isolated instance of the operating system, CPU, memory, disk, and network interfaces. 
* VM isolation is strong, as VMs emulate separate hardware environments, making them suitable for running different operating systems or legacy applications with specific dependencies. However, VMs have larger resource footprints due to the need for a complete operating system for each instance, and they typically take longer to start and stop compared to containers.

## **Containers**
  
  *   Containers, on the other hand, are lightweight, isolated environments that share the host system's kernel and run as separate processes. 
  *   They use operating system-level virtualization to package applications along with their dependencies and configurations into a single, portable unit. 
  *   Containers are more lightweight compared to VMs because they do not need to emulate a full operating system. They share the host system's OS kernel,
      which results in faster startup times and lower resource use. Because of their lightweight nature, containers can run in higher numbers on the same
      host, making efficient use of resources. 
  *   Containers are ideal for running modern, microservices-based applications, promoting scalability, agility, and reproducibility by providing a standardized 
      and portable environment. Although containers offer less isolation compared to VMs since they share the host system's kernel, they use mechanisms like 
      namespaces and control groups to ensure process-level isolation and resource management.

### **Important concept of Docker**
 
   - **Containerization:** Docker utilizes containerization technology to create and run containers. A container is a standalone executable unit that includes everything needed to run an application, such as code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies. Docker containers are based on the Docker image format, which is a lightweight, read-only template that contains all the instructions for creating a container. 
 
  - **Docker Engine:** Docker Engine is the core component of Docker that runs and manages containers. It provides an environment to build, run, and manage containers, including features like container orchestration, resource management, networking, and storage.
 
  - **Docker image:** A lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries and systems tools.
 
  - **Docker file:** A Docker file is a text-based script that defines the steps to build a Docker image. It specifies the base image, required dependencies, configuration settings, and other instructions necessary to create a container. Docker files allow developers to automate the containerization process and ensure reproducibility.
 
  - **Docker Hub:** Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry that hosts a wide range of Docker images. It serves as a central repository where users can discover, download, and share Docker images. Docker Hub provides both official images maintained by Docker as well as user contributed images. 
 
  - **Docker Compose:** Docker Compose is a tool that simplifies the orchestration of multi-container applications. It allows developers to define and manage the configuration of multiple interconnected containers as a single unit. Docker Compose files specify the services, networks, and volumes required for the application, enabling easy deployment and scaling of complex applications. 

### **Docker solves problems** 
       
  -	**Consistent Environment:** Docker provides consistent environments across development, testing, and production by encapsulating the application and its dependencies into a container.

  -	**Dependency Management:**  Docker containers package an application along with all its dependencies, ensuring that the application runs the same way regardless of where it is deployed

  - **Portability:** Containers can run on any system with docker installed, irrespective of the  
underlying infrastructure or cloud provider 

  - **Scalability:** Docker empowers developers to create or destroy several instances of the application in response to user demands.

  - **Security:** Docker provides isolation at the process level, reducing the attack surface and enabling better security controls.

  - **Isolation:** Docker containers provide process isolation, ensuring that each application runs in its own isolated environment
