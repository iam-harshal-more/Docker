- Docker Container Lifecycle Management
 
The lifecycle of a docker container consists of five states:
1.	Created state
2.	Running state
3.	Paused state
4.	unpaused state
5.	Stopped state
6.	Killed/Deleted state


1.	Created state
      In the created state, a docker container is created from a docker image

2.	Running state
In the running state, the docker container starts executing the commands mentioned in the image. To run a docker container, use the docker run command.

3.	Paused state
      In the paused state, the current executing command in the docker container is paused. 
      Use the docker pause command to pause a running container.

   Note: docker pause pauses all the processes in the container. It sends the SIGSTOP signal to
   pause the processes in the container.




















4.	Unpaused state
In the unpaused state, the paused container resumes executing the commands once it is unpaused. 
Use the docker unpause command to resume a paused container.
Then, Docker sends the SIGCONT signal to resume the process.

5.	Stopped state
In the stopped state, the container’s main process is shutdown gracefully. Docker sends SIGTERM for graceful shutdown, and if needed, SIGKILL, to kill the container’s main process. Use the docker stop command to stop a container.

6.	Killed/Deleted state
In the killed state, the container’s main processes are shutdown abruptly. Docker sends a SIGKILL signal to kill the container’s main process.
