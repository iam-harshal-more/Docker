# Docker File Instruction

#### A Docker file is a text file that contains a set of instructions used to build a Docker image. It provides a declarative and reproducible way to define the environment and configuration of a containerized application. With a Docker file, you can automate the process of building images and ensure consistent setups across different environments. A typical Docker file consists of a series of instructions that are executed in order to build the image layer by layer. It is always named Dockerfile.

- FROM
-	RUN
-	CMD
-	ENTRYPOINT
-	ENV
-	ARG
-	WORKDIR
-	EXPOSE
-	VOLUME
-	USER
-	LABEL
-	MAINTAINER
-	COPY
-	ADD

#### 1)	FROM: Defines a base image, it can be pulled from docker hub
 (for example- if we want to create a javascript application with node as backend then we need to have node as a base image, so it can run node application.)

Syntax:

   FROM java:1.8
   
   FROM mysql:8.5

   FROM tomcat:9.5
   
   FROM python:1.2

#### 2)	RUN: RUN instructions will execute while creating docker image

Syntax:

 RUN yum install git
  
 RUN yum install maven
  
 RUN git clone <repo-url>

 RUN cd <repo-name>

 RUN mvn clean package

#### 3)	CMD: CMD instructions will execute while creating docker container Using CMD command we can run our application in container.

Syntax:

CMD sudo start tomcat

CMD java -jar <jar-file>

##### Note: We can write multiple CMD instructions but docker engine will process only last CMD instruction.

#### 4)	ENTRYPOINT: It is used to execute instructions while creating container

Syntax:

ENTRYPOINT [ "echo" , "Container Created Successfully" ]

ENTRYPOINT [ "java", "-jar", "target/springboot.jar" ]

#### 5)	ENV: Sets environment variables inside the image

Syntax:

ENV java /etc/softwares/jdk

#### 6)	ARG: By using ARG we can take dynamic values from CLI It is used to remove hard coded values in Docker file

Syntax: 

ARG branch

RUN git clone -b $branch <repo-url>

$ docker build -t <imagename> --build-arg branch=master.

#### 7)	WORKDIR: It is used to specify working directory for image and container

 Syntax: 

WORKDIR /app/usr/

#### 8)	EXPOSE: It is used to specify on which port number our docker container will run (It is only used for documentation)

Syntax: 

EXPOSE 8080

#### 9)	VOLUME: It defines which directory in an image should be treated as a volume. The volume will be given a random name which can be found using docker inspect command.

#### 10)	 USER: It is used to specify username for creating image / container.

Syntax: 

USER dockeruser

#### 11)	LABEL: It is used to add METADATA to docker objects in key-value format

Syntax: 

LABEL name="icici_image"


##### 12)	MAINTAINER: It is used to specify docker file author information

Syntax:

MAINTAINER Harshal harshalmore.it@gmail.com
 
#### 13)	COPY: It is used to copy the files from source to destination while creating docker image

Syntax:

COPY Source_path Destination_path

Ex:  COPY  target/sb-api.war  /app/tomcat/webapps/sb-api.war

#### 14)	ADD: It is used to copy the files from source to destination while creating docker image
Syntax:

ADD Source_path Destination_path

ADD HTTP-URL DESTINATION

Ex: ADD  <url>   /app/tomcat/webapps/sb-api.war

## Sample Docker file for simple java application

Use an official OpenJDK runtime as a parent image

    FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim
    
 Set the working directory in the container
 
    WORKDIR /usr/src/app
    
Copy the executable JAR file to the working directory

      COPY target/myapp.jar .
      
Make port 8080 available to the world outside this container

      EXPOSE 8080
      
Define the command to run the application

   CMD ["java", "-jar", "myapp.jar"]
